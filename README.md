# Hotel Review Sentiment Analysis

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate various machine learning models for sentiment analysis of hotel reviews. The project focuses on:

1. **Data Collection and Preparation:**
   - Gathering and cleaning hotel review data.
   - Preprocessing the data and labeling sentiments based on ratings.

2. **Model Development:**
   - Implementing classification models such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
   - Converting text data into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization.

3. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Assessing performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Visualizing results with confusion matrices and comparison charts.

4. **Optimization and Tuning:**
   - Tuning hyperparameters for improved model performance.
   - Using cross-validation to ensure robustness.

5. **Reporting Results:**
   - Presenting findings through detailed metrics and visualizations.
   - Offering recommendations based on the analysis.
